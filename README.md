# vegnab-webapp   
Testing feasibility of VegNab as a web app.  
- Is offline storage in the browser robust enough?
- Can we search on plant species fast enough?
- Can the IndexedDB equivalent of Union queries work well enough?
- Is it feasible to output species lists?
- Will it be understandable to general users?
- Can we take documentation photos on the fly, and have them display correctly.
